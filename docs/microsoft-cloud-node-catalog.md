# Microsoft cloud node-type catalog

Inventory baseline: 2026-08-16; scoped product-boundary/guidance update: 2026-10-09.

*Updated: 2026-10-13 - Added the vendor-neutral Generic process, networking and storage catalog.*

SecureDesignStudio provides **198 neutral core node types** (169 Microsoft
product types plus 29 vendor-neutral Generic types), without requiring
an optional library. Selected Custom Libraries can contribute additional node
definitions or explicitly overlay a core definition. The Azure portion starts
from the 214-resource Microsoft Cloud
Adoption Framework inventory and collapses SKU/child-resource variants into
93 architecturally meaningful data-flow node families.
Use the [user guide](user-guide.md#4-advanced-features) for the modeling
workflow; this reference retains the catalog inventory and source methodology.

## Catalog policy

Catalog entries identify products, categories, public endpoint hints, resource-provider namespaces, documentation, and bundled diagram icons. They deliberately **do not assert service-specific authentication, data-classification, geo, retention, or GDPR policy**. SecureDesignStudio marks those entries as `policyStatus: Unspecified`; reviewers must confirm policy for the modeled use. The optional private entries retain their existing policy only when explicitly selected or saved in a document.

Because Microsoft services evolve continuously, this is a reviewed snapshot,
not a claim that every Azure Marketplace offer, retired SKU, preview feature,
or child ARM resource has its own node. The Azure inventory deliberately
collapses related SKUs and child resources into data-flow-relevant service
families; the linked Microsoft sources remain authoritative.

## Reviewed AI design guidance

166 of the 169 Microsoft core node types carry concise `aiDesignGuidance`:
Context, Dependencies, Risks and Uncertainty, with source URLs, authored
revision and edit date. Guidance remains withheld for Virtual machine
infrastructure, Network security and Route resources. Custom Libraries can
supply guidance for additional types or explicit overlays. Dates are edit
dates, not fresh verification of a deployment or every linked page. Saved
diagram definitions remain authoritative and are not rewritten by catalog
updates.

New default choices:

| Stable ID | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Dataverse` | Managed business-data platform, not customer-owned Cosmos DB or a private internal service alias. |
| `Dataverse Table` | Contained table accessed through parent Dataverse APIs; table kind affects storage and auditing. |
| `Dataverse Plugin` | Registered synchronous/asynchronous server-side handler, potentially making external calls; not a guarantee of one shared OS process. |
| `CopilotStudio` | Public agent/workflow authoring and management product, distinct from `m365_copilot` and `Agent365`. |
| `PowerPlatformConnectors` | Connector family; identify the actual connector, connection identity, operation and backend. |

Azure scopes preserve variant differences: WAF is Web
Application Firewall at public application entry points; Delivery covers
Azure Front Door and legacy Azure CDN; Azure Files covers both classic
account-contained and standalone shares; Managed Redis stays scoped to
`Microsoft.Cache/RedisEnterprise`; Azure Enclave is a managed deployment
composite. These definitions do not imply every listed component or control is
deployed. VM infrastructure, Network security and Route remain without
guidance.

For the request “a Power Pages application backed by Copilot to summarize
Dataverse data,” the public choices support `PowerPages` → `CopilotStudio` →
`Dataverse` directly. This is a proposed architecture, not a guarantee of a
configured integration. Confirm the intended Copilot product, supported
channel/data path, effective identity, table/row/column authorization and
summary audience. Do not substitute Microsoft 365 Copilot merely because it
was previously the only available Copilot choice. Table, plug-in, connector,
AI Search and Azure OpenAI nodes are not automatically required.

Descriptions distinguish Power Apps canvas/model-driven apps, Power Automate
cloud/desktop flows, Customer Insights Data/Journeys, the Dynamics suite,
Finance versus F&O platform, Sales Insights capabilities and Project Operations
deployment branches. Agent 365 is categorized as cross-product governance;
the on-premises gateway is shared integration infrastructure. Customer Voice
lifecycle and Intelligent Order Management production-availability questions
remain explicit uncertainty, not inferred retirement or provisioning approval.

The five new entries use `^$` with no matching hints: no unique public endpoint
classifier is established. Existing CRM/F&O wildcard hints are retained for
compatibility but **do not uniquely identify a Dynamics application**. A
table/API resource is not a separately hosted table hostname; this conservative
matching choice does not claim Dataverse has no APIs.

Saved definitions remain authoritative, including old names and an absent
guidance field; there is no wholesale migration. New core types omit default
DFD roles rather than inferring them; explicitly choose Process/Data Store as
appropriate for a modeled instance. Guidance is untrusted reference text, not
policy, a risk waiver or permission to create dependencies.

## Updating the catalog in the app

Open **Model > Node Type Catalog**. The catalog editor can:

- create a document-local type with a stable ID;
- override a shipped label, endpoint pattern, icon, documentation, or policy;
- edit auth, data, privacy, geo, retention, and GDPR rules;
- reset a shipped type to its built-in definition;
- delete an unused document type;
- export all document definitions as `secure-design-studio-node-catalog.json`; and
- import that package into another document.

Authentication policies use the same **Model > Customize authentication**
library as flow selectors. Node-catalog packages include referenced
`authenticationDefinitions`; missing or conflicting dependencies produce an
actionable error instead of silently removing policy rules. Importing a node
catalog does not replace browser-profile library preferences. See the
[Authentication Library contract](authentication-library.md).

These definitions are document-local model data rather than source-code
changes. They are included in `.tma` export/import, autosave, standalone HTML,
undo/redo, Compare to previous, and collaboration. An override affects the
current document only. It does not update the repository catalog or other
models. A shipped catalog update still belongs in
`src/data/microsoftCloudNodeTypes.json`; the editor is the low-friction path for
prototyping and distributing new definitions before they are promoted into the
product snapshot.

For a first model, select each node and review both inspector tabs:

- **General / Security**: confirm the type, Inventory ID, endpoint
  pattern, and displayed authentication policy. Audience, constraints, and
  production identity are recorded on flows, not the node.
- **Privacy**: confirm allowed data rules, scenario data and retention, default
  privacy boundary, geographic behavior, post-subscription retention, and GDPR
  handling.

`policyStatus: Unspecified` identifies the service but makes no curated
authentication or data-policy claim. Empty fields are not permission to use any
authentication method or data class. Distinguish type policy from node
overrides and scenario-specific data: the type provides catalog guidance, a
node records deployment-specific overrides, and each scenario records its own
edge data attachments and node retention. Confirm Unspecified or deferred
values with the responsible security and privacy reviewers. See the
[user guide](user-guide.md#4-advanced-features) for the complete workflow.

## Counts

| Catalog source | Types |
|---|---:|
| Dynamics 365 | 16 |
| Generic (vendor-neutral) | 29 |
| Microsoft 365 | 40 |
| Microsoft Azure | 93 |
| Microsoft Fabric | 9 |
| Power Platform | 11 |
| **Neutral core total** | **198** |
| Optional Custom entries | 13 |
| Same-ID optional/core overlap | -3 |
| **Combined with Custom** | **208** |

Catalog-source grouping preserves the original source attribution; category
labels independently identify Agent 365 governance and shared gateway roles.

## Generic (vendor-neutral)

`src/data/genericNodeTypes.json` supplies 29 product-agnostic types for any
platform (on-premises, any cloud or hybrid). IDs use the stable
`generic.<area>.<kind>` form. Open **Model > Node Type Catalog** and choose
**Generic** in the **Catalog** selector. **Microsoft** groups Azure, Microsoft
365, Dynamics 365, Fabric and Power Platform; **All node types** includes
everything. Future catalog choices are derived from `catalogSource` metadata,
without additional Model commands. Search is scoped to the selected catalog.
Unlike Microsoft product entries, each Generic
type sets an intentional **default DFD role**: Process for compute and
networking, External Interactor for clients and devices, Data Store for storage.
Icons are original SDS artwork under `src/assets/node-icons/neutral/`.

| Category | Types |
|---|---|
| Generic / Process | Host (server / VM), Container workload, Serverless function (FaaS), Web application, API service, Background worker / scheduled job |
| Generic / Client and device | Desktop / mobile client app, Browser / single-page app client, IoT / edge device |
| Generic / Networking | Router, Switch, Firewall, Web application firewall, Load balancer, Reverse proxy / API gateway, VPN gateway, NAT gateway, DNS service, Bastion / jump host |
| Generic / Storage | Relational database, NoSQL database, Object storage, File share / NAS (SMB/NFS), Block storage / SAN / disk volume, Cache, Message queue / broker / event stream, Log / telemetry store, Secrets / key vault / HSM, Backup / archive |

Every Generic type carries reviewed `aiDesignGuidance` (≤2,400 characters)
with six sections — Context, Modeling, Dependencies, Risks, Controls to verify
and Uncertainty — and 2–5 vendor-neutral sources (NIST, OWASP, CISA, CIS,
MITRE, IETF and similar). Modeling explains when to use the type, how to split
it into nodes/boundaries and which data flows to draw; Controls to verify lists
checks the reviewer should confirm rather than assume. Like other core entries,
Generic types assert no authentication, data or retention policy
(`policyStatus: Unspecified`) and no endpoint classifier (`endpointRegex: "^$"`).
Prefer a specific product type when one exists; use Generic when the product
is unknown, self-hosted or from another vendor.
