# Contributing and local validation

SecureDesignStudio uses TypeScript, React, Vite and Node's built-in test runner.
Use Node 24 LTS (`.nvmrc`), npm and an installed Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome
browser for browser tests. They use Edge by default; on macOS and Linux set
`SDS_TEST_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome`. The tests never download a browser.
CI runs blocking browser checks on Windows, macOS and Linux x64. Linux ARM's
hosted image has no supported preinstalled Chrome/Edge channel; its required
build, runtime and launcher checks do not establish browser coverage.
Ordinary editing/building requires no cloud credentials or agent tooling.

## Development

Run `npm ci` for a fresh checkout, then `npm run dev`. The frontend binds
strictly to `http://localhost:5173/`; it does not start an API or enable
collaboration. Do not stop another user's listener or silently choose a new
port. The optional AI workflow is separate; see
[advanced configuration](advanced-configuration.md).

For an overview of the components, data model and design decisions, start
with [architecture and design](architecture.md); [use cases](use-cases.md)
maps each workflow to its source and tests.

Before changing behavior, inspect the current source and existing tests.
Preserve stable IDs, scenario ownership, saved definitions, old-file
compatibility and one-step Undo. Keep private data, credentials and real
customer/service exports out of fixtures.

## Check a change

| Surface | Command |
|---|---|
| Documentation only | Check links, anchors, examples and implementation claims; parse changed Mermaid diagrams. No unrelated runtime build is needed. |
| Frontend runtime, dependencies or build configuration | `npm run build` (typecheck, normal and standalone output) |
| Model, import/export, catalogs or pure helpers | `npm run test:runtime` |
| UI and current application behavior | `npm run test:browser` (regression and automated usability union) |
| Browser runner | `npm run test:browser:unit` plus the browser union |
| Optional library behavior | `npm run test:libraries:browser`; configured production checks as described in the browser guide |
| API implementation | `npm --prefix api run build`, plus relevant frontend/request-contract checks |
| Standalone persistence | `npm run test:authentication:production` after building |
| Service configuration | The explicit configuration matrix in the browser guide and `service-build.json` verification |

`test:runtime` is the agent-independent pure application suite. In the public
package, `test:authentication` is an alias for it. Companion integrations have
their own test command and are not required to run shared runtime tests.
There is no generic `npm test` or lint script.

There is no `overrides` block: the lockfile resolves a patched `shell-quote`
(dev-only, through `concurrently`), and CI's `npm audit` fails on any new
high-severity advisory. Standalone HTML uses
the repository-owned `scripts/single-file-build.mjs` inliner rather than
`vite-plugin-singlefile`, removing its unpatched `braces` dependency chain.
The Vite 8 inliner embeds all emitted scripts/styles and fails if any emitted
script/style is left unembedded. The dependency-notices tests cover inlining,
literal closing-tag escaping and missing-resource failures. Selective
glob-based inlining is intentionally not supported.

See the [browser guide](../tests/browser/README.md) for exact coverage,
configuration-specific production tests, synthetic fixtures and output paths.
Run browser suites serially; they own and stop only their own server.
Assistant production navigation tests require an explicitly configured
same-origin endpoint and intercept responses rather than calling a live API.
Restore the intended service configuration after testing.

## Review and release boundaries

Record the source/target commits, dirty input, commands and exit codes,
selected service/library configuration, and artifact hashes. Missing, failing,
skipped or stale required checks cannot count as passing. Review test,
dependency and build-policy changes independently of their own results.
Automated layout/focus checks are not human-usability research, a screen-reader
audit or proof of deployed behavior.

Keep generated output, dependencies, TypeScript build metadata, local settings
and test evidence outside commits. Inspect `git diff --check` and the complete
diff. Keep the application versions in `package.json` and both root lockfile
fields synchronized; use `npm version <version> --no-git-tag-version
--ignore-scripts` only for an intended version change, not every build.
Release maintainers review version intent and approval separately from builds.

No build or test command authorizes deployment, repository publication,
license selection or asset redistribution. Preserve component notices and
check [third-party provenance](third-party-notices.md). Root licensing and
other release clearances are not implied by those component notices.
